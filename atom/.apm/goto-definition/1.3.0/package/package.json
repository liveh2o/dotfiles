Install `ripgrep`, see [https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation). Yeap, now we use `ripgrep` to search definitions, because of it's incredibly fast.\n2. Turn `Settings -> Packages -> goto-definition -> Settings -> Performance Mode` on.\n3. Enjoy it.\n\nNow the performance model is still testing, welcome suggestions and feedback. If it goes well, we will open the performance mode by default in the next version.\n\n### Ignoring files\n\nIn performance mode, if you want ignore some files, you can create a file called `.ignore` in the root of the project, it working like `.gitignore`.\n\n### Notice\n\n* In nomal model, if you want include VCS ignored paths, please turn `Settings -> Exclude VCS Ignored Paths` option off.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"goto-definition@1.3.0","_shasum":"662d0e5cedc3a8ecf14e0de6c961a9616a858be6","_resolved":"file:../d-117229-56726-axcybb/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117229-56726-axcybb/package.tgz"}
