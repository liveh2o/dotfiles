From that version onward, the version of `react-for-atom` matches the React version.\n\nChanges to `react-for-atom` are reflected in pre-release versions (e.g. `0.14.6-1`). From a semver perspective, this doesn't make sense. However, because you should pin the version of `react-for-atom` anyway, this is a clear workaround for conveying React versioning info.\n","maintainers":[{"email":"jonas@jonasgebhardt.com","name":"jxg"},{"email":"opensource+npm@fb.com","name":"fb"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-07-26T20:31:52.484Z","created":"2015-05-08T22:05:12.474Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-08T22:05:12.474Z","0.13.2":"2015-05-08T22:59:48.935Z","0.13.2-b":"2015-05-11T18:39:22.554Z","0.13.3":"2015-05-19T22:49:56.807Z","0.13.5":"2015-05-19T22:57:24.624Z","0.13.6":"2015-05-19T23:10:21.175Z","0.14.2":"2015-11-11T20:43:06.029Z","0.14.3":"2015-11-11T21:12:39.233Z","0.14.6":"2016-01-22T19:54:01.238Z","0.14.6-0":"2016-01-29T18:27:14.620Z","0.14.7-0":"2016-02-03T20:54:43.158Z","15.0.1-0":"2016-04-13T23:52:07.243Z","15.0.2-0":"2016-05-05T02:36:38.264Z","15.0.2-1":"2016-05-24T16:44:02.988Z","15.2.1-0":"2016-07-21T02:33:24.423Z","15.3.1-0":"2016-09-13T14:40:10.699Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom.git"},"author":{"name":"Jonas Gebhardt","email":"jxg@fb.com"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jgebhardt/react-for-atom/issues"},"readmeFilename":"README.md","license":"BSD-3-Clause","keywords":["atom","react"],"users":{"alimaster":true,"danseethaler":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"5978fc38-6655\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 26 Jul 2017 20:31:52 GMT","_cached":true}
