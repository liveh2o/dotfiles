Adding a feature can be quick and easy. Check out the [closed pull requests][prs] to see examples of community contributions, and look at the [issues][issues] to see if anyone has already solved your problem.\n\n[prs]: https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed\n[issues]: https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/issues\n\n### Installing\n\nUse the Atom package manager, which can be found in the Settings view or run `apm install vim-mode` from the command line.\n\n### Issues and Limitations\n\nIf you want the Vim ex line (for `:w`, `:s`, etc.), you can try [ex-mode](https://atom.io/packages/ex-mode)\nwhich works in conjunction with this plugin.\n\nCurrently, vim-mode has some issues with non-US keyboard layouts. If you are using a keyboard layout which *isn't* American and having problems, try installing [keyboard-localization](https://atom.io/packages/keyboard-localization).\n\n### Development\n\n* Create a branch with your feature/fix.\n* Add a spec (take inspiration from the ones that are already there).\n* Create a PR.\n\nWhen in doubt, open a PR earlier rather than later and join [#vim-mode](https://atomio.slack.com/messages/vim-mode/) on the [Atom Slack](http://atom-slack.herokuapp.com/) so that you can receive\nfeedback from the community. We want to get your fix or feature included as much\nas you do.\n\nSee [the contribution guide](https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/atom/vim-mode/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/atom/vim-mode#readme","_id":"vim-mode@0.63.0","_shasum":"4ec31220547f0c6e4741b315273c5f09b7fff74e","_resolved":"file:../d-115111-13335-1el7k3g/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115111-13335-1el7k3g/package.tgz"}
