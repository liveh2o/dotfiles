## 0.3.1 - First True Patch
* Added Focus Mode
    - Focus Mode ensures that you only see what's important when it's important.
    - For Tabs, only active or modified tabs are full opacity
    - For the Tree View, only open folders have full opacity. Remember to collapse any folders that aren't currently in use.
    - Future updates will include javascript that will automatically display in the Tree View only the items that are currently open.
    - The status bar below will not be at full opacity unless hovered over. However, the bugs and deprecations notifications will always be at full opacity.
    - For those who don't like how Focus Mode effects the Tree View, feel free to reach out to me via GitHub. I'll do what I can to ensure that everyone is able to enjoy this theme (thank you!)
* Added slight hover effect in Tree View
* In Tree View, the selected item is both white and button-background-color-selected
