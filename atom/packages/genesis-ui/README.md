# Genesis Atom UI

This is a UI theme to the <a href="https://atom.io/themes/genesis-syntax">Genesis Syntax Theme</a>. Its light, minimalistic design is meant to be a welcome contrast to the syntax theme.

Genesis UI features a <b><i>Focus Mode*</i></b> that lowers the opacity of all UI elements that are not immediately relevant--unless hovered on. The most noticeable characteristic of Focus Mode is how it effects your Tree View. In Focus Mode, your Tree View will only display open folders--unless hovered on. The purpose of this is to minimize the distraction of websites with complex directories, allowing you to only see the files that you're currently working with.
